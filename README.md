    <p>I am Manar Dawod, a fourth-year student in the Computer Science at Birzeit University. I have a great passion for software development and interface design. I have the ability to work both independently and collaboratively, as I have worked on several individual and group projects. Additionally, I have a self-learning ability, so I strive to develop my skills in web and mobile development.
